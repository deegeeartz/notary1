        <h3>About Notary/Notaio </h3>
        <p id="p1">Buying a property in Italy may seem quite daunting – the Italian bureaucracy is indeed known for causing confusion. However, even if buying a house in Italy is definitely different from buying a house in the USA, it is actually a straightforward
            process. <br> Moreover, purchasing a property in Italy is perfectly safe and legal for American citizens. The entire process of buying a property requires the presence of professionals who will have different roles. In other words, you’ll
            need a lawyer, a public accountant and a surveyor. <br> One of the most essential figures in this field is the Notary, “notaio”, a public officer whose role is to authenticate important legal paperwork. However, the role of the Notary goes
            further than this. <br> A Notary is a neutral party who assists the client throughout the purchase process. At the beginning of negotiations, the buyer has the right to choose the Notary who will check the accuracy of the paperwork regarding
            the property. <br> Choosing a Notary is entirely up to the client who will pay the Notary fees. However, when purchasing a house through a real estate agent, foreign buyers often seek help from the Notary who has been recommended to them by
            the agents. In any case, the Notary should be based in the same area of the property you are purchasing.
