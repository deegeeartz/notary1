            <h3>About Notary/Notaio </h3>
            <p id="p1">Buying a property in Italy may seem quite daunting – the Italian bureaucracy is indeed known for causing confusion. However, even if buying a house in Italy is definitely different from buying a house in the USA, it is actually a straightforward
                process. <br> Moreover, purchasing a property in Italy is perfectly safe and legal for American citizens. The entire process of buying a property requires the presence of professionals who will have different roles. In other words, you’ll
                need a lawyer, a public accountant and a surveyor. <br> One of the most essential figures in this field is the Notary, “notaio”, a public officer whose role is to authenticate important legal paperwork. However, the role of the Notary
                goes further than this. <br> A Notary is a neutral party who assists the client throughout the purchase process. At the beginning of negotiations, the buyer has the right to choose the Notary who will check the accuracy of the paperwork
                regarding the property. <br> Choosing a Notary is entirely up to the client who will pay the Notary fees. However, when purchasing a house through a real estate agent, foreign buyers often seek help from the Notary who has been recommended
                to them by the agents. In any case, the Notary should be based in the same area of the property you are purchasing.

                <strong>Is investing in the Italian real estate market safe?</strong><br> Italy is a beautiful country with a special and unique culture. Furthermore, it is a founding member of the European Union (EU) and a member of the Euro Zone. The
                conveyance process in Italy is regulated by the Italian Civil Code and it is very safe. However, it is fundamental (as generally required for any investment) that the purchaser pays attention to a number of details and makes sure that
                the seller is entitled to sell the property (an Italian professional can help you to perform these checks). <br><br>
                <strong>What is the average time required from formalizing
                        an offer to completing the purchasing process?</strong>
                <br> Assuming no particular problems arise, after the legal due diligence is carried out by an attorney or by another professionals, the whole process can be completed in 4 – 6 weeks. <br><br>
                <strong>Do I need an Italian Tax Code to complete the
                        transaction? What are the requirements and how long does
                        it take to obtain a tax code?</strong><br> The “Codice Fiscale” is commonly translated as “Tax Code” or “Fiscal Code” or “Tax Number”. It is an Italian identification code which is necessary to perform many financial
                transactions in Italy, including real estate transactions. A Tax Code for individuals, as opposed to private entities, is formed by 16 alphanumerical characters which take into account an individual’s name, date and place of birth. <br><br>
                <strong>Do I need an Italian Bank Account to complete the
                        transaction?</strong><br> Although having an Italian Bank Account is not mandatory to complete the transaction, it is highly advisable to set-up an Italian Bank Account to simplify the transfer of funds from the
                buyer to the seller. Furthermore, non-Italian citizens and non-Italian residents can open an Italian bank account. Non-Italian residents are allowed to open non-resident bank accounts (“conto corrente per non residenti”) regardless of
                their nationality. <br><br>
                <strong> Should I use a real estate agent to complete the
                        purchase?</strong><br> Although it is not mandatory to use the services offered by a real estate agent under Italian law, many investors find it easier to do so . If you need help from a real estate agent, you should
                make sure that the agent is registered with the local Chamber of Commerce (“Ruolo degli Agenti di Affari in Mediazione”), as required by Italian law. You can also decide to purchase the property directly from the seller without the real
                estate agency’s help and this will save you money in terms of the agency’s commission fees (normally 3% of the purchase price). However, this last solution may be safe only if you are assisted by an Italian legal advisor who is bilingual.

                <strong>Unfortunately, I don’t have sufficient energy or
                        time to travel to Italy. Would it be feasible for
                        another person to represent me and finalize the purchase
                        on my behalf so I can avoid travelling back and forth?</strong><br> Yes, it is possible to delegate somebody you trust to complete the purchase of a property in Italy on your behalf by means of a Power of Attorney
                (“Procura Speciale”). A Power of Attorney (PoA) gives another individual the power to legally represent you during the purchasing process in Italy. In other words, you can give an Italian attorney or any other trusted individual the ability
                to act on your behalf and legally represent you in all the formalities that need to be completed in order to finalize the purchase. <br><br>

                <strong>Can I grant a Power of Attorney only for the
                        completion of one specific formality or do I have to
                        grant a Power of Attorney for the management of the
                        whole process in Italy?</strong><br> A Power of Attorney can be as vast or restricted as you need. In fact, it can be limited to one particular formality or it can include the powers to handle all of the aspects
                where your signature and presence would be required (for example during the negotiation and determination of the purchase price, declaration of specific personal circumstances, application for tax reduction, etc.). It is also possible
                to use a Power of Attorney to apply for a mortgage. In conclusion, a Power of Attorney can be used throughout the entire process of purchasing a property in Italy without being physically present in the country at any time. <br><br>
                <strong>Why should I hire a lawyer when I am already using
                        the services of an Italian Notary Public?</strong><br> The Italian legal system attributes to a Public notary (“Notaio Pubblico”) a predominant role in drafting the purchase agreement of Italian real estate. Unlike
                common law countries where the role played by lawyers in real estate transactions is exhaustive, Italian attorneys are involved in transactions mainly during the initial phases of the purchasing process. These include carrying out due
                diligence and negotiating the terms and conditions between the parties. On the other hand, an Italian Public Notary has a very specific role under Italian law. Italian Public Notaries do not represent the seller or the buyer, rather, they
                serve as neutral parties who work for the Italian Government. <br><br>


                <strong>Do I need an interpreter to sign the contract of
                        sale before the Notary? If yes, can I use one appointed
                        by the vendor and/or the real estate agent?</strong><br> When signing the Deed of Sale, if the purchaser is not fluent in Italian, the Italian law requires the presence of an interpreter. If the interpreter is appointed
                by the vendor and/or by the real estate agent it is advisable to verify that the interpreter is indeed qualified both from a legal and a linguistic point of view. It is against the law for an interpreter to have a conflict of interest
                against one of the parties.

                <strong>I need to renovate my property and I am already in
                        contact with a contractor. Will I need a contract?</strong><br> Yes, usually renovation works are part of legally binding contracts. It is always advisable to have a contract which has been professionally drafted
                by a lawyer where all of the obligations, terms, conditions and fees are listed in detail. This can save time and money and might prevent the need of a lawsuit in case the contractor does not fulfill its obligations.

                <strong>I am in the process of purchasing a property in
                        Italy. As of now, I do not have an Italian attorney who
                        can represent me but I have a few legal matters that I
                        would like to discuss. Can you help me?</strong><br> Definitely! Contact us by using the contact section on this website and we will reply within 24 hours.
